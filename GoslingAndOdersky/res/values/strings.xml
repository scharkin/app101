    <string name="first_person_description" translatable="false">James Arthur Gosling (born May 19, 1955) is a Canadian computer scientist, best known as the father of the Java programming language.
Gosling is generally credited with having invented the Java programming language in 1994. He created the original design of Java and implemented the language\'s original compiler and virtual machine. Gosling traces the origins of the approach to his early graduate-student days, when he created a pseudo-code (p-code) virtual machine for the lab\'s DEC VAX computer, so that his professor could run programs written in UCSD Pascal. Pascal compiled into p-code to foster precisely this kind of portability. In the work leading to Java at Sun, he saw that architecture-neutral execution for widely distributed programs could be achieved by implementing a similar philosophy: always program for the same virtual machine.
For his achievement the National Academy of Engineering in the United States elected him as a Foreign Associate member. He has also made major contributions to several other software systems, such as NeWS and Gosling Emacs. He co-wrote the "bundle" program, a utility thoroughly detailed in Brian Kernighan and Rob Pike\'s book The Unix Programming Environment.</string>

    <string name="second_person_description" translatable="false">Martin Odersky (born 5 September 1958) is a German computer scientist and professor of programming methods at EPFL in Switzerland. He specializes in code analysis and programming languages. He designed the Scala programming language and Generic Java, and built the current generation of javac, the Java compiler. In 2007 he was inducted as a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery.
In 1989, he received his Ph.D. from ETH Zurich under the supervision of Niklaus Wirth, who is best known as the designer of several programming languages (including Pascal). He did postdoctoral work at IBM and Yale.
In 2011, he founded Typesafe Inc., a company to support and promote Scala, and he currently serves as the chairman and chief architect.
He teaches two courses on the massive open online course provider, Coursera, namely Functional Programming Principles in Scala and Principles of Reactive Programming.</string>
